Networking is a big part of what made computers so powerful and why the Internet exists. It allows machines to communicate with each other.

+ **What is a protocol**

Network protocols are sets of established rules that dictate how to format, transmit and receive data so computer network devices -- from servers and routers to endpoints -- can communicate regardless of the differences in their underlying infrastructures, designs or standards.
A set of cooperating network protocols is called a protocol suite. The TCP/IP suite includes numerous protocols across layers -- such as the data, network, transport and application layers -- working together to enable internet connectivity. These include:

+  + Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which uses a set of rules to exchange messages with other internet points at the information packet level;
+  + User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which acts as an alternative communication protocol to TCP and is used to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications and the Internet.
+  + Internet Protocol (IP), which uses a set of rules to send and receive messages at the Internet address level
+  + additional network protocols that include the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP), each of which has defined sets of rules to exchange and display information.
  
Major types of network protocols </br>
Generally speaking, networks have three types of protocols -- communication, such as Ethernet; management, such as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP); and security, such as Secure Shell (SSH).



+ **What is an IP address**

Every machine on a network has a unique identifier. Just as you would address a letter to send in the mail, computers use the unique identifier to send data to specific computers on a network. Most networks today, including all computers on the internet, use the TCP/IP protocol as the standard for how to communicate on the network. In the TCP/IP protocol, the unique identifier for a computer is called its IP address.
